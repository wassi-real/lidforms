# Supabase Configuration for Disabling Email Confirmation

## Dashboard Configuration

To disable email confirmation for easier signup, you need to configure Supabase through the dashboard:

### Steps:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Visit [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
   - Select your LidForm project

2. **Navigate to Authentication Settings**
   - Go to `Authentication` → `Settings`
   - Scroll down to `Email Confirmation`

3. **Disable Email Confirmation**
   - **Uncheck** "Enable email confirmations"
   - **Save** the changes

4. **Alternative: Configure Email Templates (Optional)**
   - If you want to keep email confirmation but make it automatic:
   - Go to `Authentication` → `Email Templates`
   - Set `Confirm signup` template to auto-confirm

### Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` file has the correct Supabase configuration:

```env
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### Code Changes Made

The signup function has been updated to:

1. **Remove email redirect options** - No longer sends confirmation emails
2. **Direct redirect to dashboard** - Users go straight to dashboard after signup
3. **Simplified success message** - Clear feedback that account is created

### Result

- ✅ Users can sign up immediately without email confirmation
- ✅ Automatic redirect to dashboard after successful signup
- ✅ Google OAuth still works normally
- ✅ No email verification step required

### Security Note

Disabling email confirmation means:
- Users can sign up with any email (even if they don't own it)
- Consider implementing other security measures if needed
- Email confirmation can be re-enabled anytime in the Supabase dashboard
