# 🔒 SECURE RLS Setup - Fixed Security Issue

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY FIX

The previous RLS policies were **TOO PERMISSIVE** and allowed everyone to see everyone's forms. This fix ensures proper security:

### 🔐 Security Model:

1. **Form Owners (Authenticated Users):**
   - ✅ Can see and manage ONLY their own forms
   - ✅ Can see submissions for their own forms only
   - ✅ Can edit/delete their own forms and fields

2. **Public Users (Anonymous):**
   - ✅ Can see ONLY active/shared forms (is_active = true)
   - ✅ Can submit to active forms only
   - ❌ Cannot see inactive forms or other users' private forms
   - ❌ Cannot see submissions from other users

3. **Form Sharing:**
   - ✅ When you set `is_active = true` on a form, it becomes publicly visible
   - ✅ When you set `is_active = false`, it becomes private to you only

## 🚀 Quick Fix Instructions:

### Step 1: Apply the Secure RLS
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `fix-secure-rls.sql`
4. Click **Run**

### Step 2: Test Security
1. **Log out** of your app
2. **Open incognito browser**
3. Try to access your form URL: `http://localhost:5173/f/[your-form-id]`
4. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Active forms are visible and submittable
   - ❌ Inactive forms show "Form not found"
   - ❌ Cannot access other users' forms directly

### Step 3: Test Dashboard Access
1. **Log back in** to your account
2. **Go to dashboard**
3. **Verify:**
   - ✅ Only see your own forms
   - ✅ Can edit/delete your own forms
   - ✅ Can see submissions for your forms only

## 🔍 How It Works:

### Forms Table:
- **Private Access:** `auth.uid() = user_id` (only form owners)
- **Public Access:** `is_active = true` (only active/shared forms)

### Form Fields Table:
- **Private Access:** Form owner can manage fields for their forms
- **Public Access:** Anyone can read fields for active forms only

### Submissions Table:
- **Private Access:** Form owner can see submissions for their forms
- **Public Access:** Anyone can submit to active forms, see their own submissions

### Submission Responses Table:
- **Private Access:** Form owner can see responses for their forms
- **Public Access:** Anyone can submit responses to active forms

## 🛡️ Security Features:

1. **User Isolation:** Each user only sees their own forms in dashboard
2. **Public Sharing:** Forms are only public when `is_active = true`
3. **Submission Privacy:** Users can only see submissions for their own forms
4. **Data Protection:** No cross-user data leakage

## ✅ Expected Behavior After Fix:

### For Form Owners:
- Dashboard shows only your forms
- Can edit/delete your own forms
- Can see submissions for your forms
- Can toggle forms between public/private with `is_active`

### For Public Users:
- Can see and submit to active forms only
- Cannot access inactive forms
- Cannot see other users' private forms
- Cannot see submissions from other users

## 🚨 Important Notes:

1. **Form Visibility:** Set `is_active = true` to make forms publicly shareable
2. **Form Privacy:** Set `is_active = false` to make forms private
3. **No Data Leakage:** Users cannot access each other's private data
4. **Secure by Default:** New forms are private until explicitly made public

This fix ensures your LidForm app is secure while maintaining the ability to share forms publicly when desired.
